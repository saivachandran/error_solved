Problem

When pushing a new repository to Bitbucket Server, the following error is returned from the Git client:

git push -u origin master

error: src refspec master does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://stash.company.com/scm/PROJECT/REPO.git'


Resolution

Create the first commit inside of the repository and then it can be pushed. For example, the following with create an initial commit and push it to the server.

touch initial

git add initial

git commit -m "initial commit"

git push -u origin master
